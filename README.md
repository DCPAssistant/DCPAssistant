# DCPAssistant
A GUI tool for easy input and selection of the best decensoring from multiple instances of [DeepCreamPy created by deeppomf](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy)

Current version: [beta 1.2.0 (TheFirstGreatRefucktoring)](https://github.com/DCPAssistant/DCPAssistant/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta)

Note: DCPAssistant works only on windows and only with the windows versions of DeepCreamPy as of now
  
How To use DCPAss:
1. Click 'Open DCP-versions' and put an untouched copy of every version of DeepCreamPy you want to use in there
2. Click 'Set output' and select the output you want your selected images saved in later
3. Click 'Open input' and put all images (bar AND mosaic, the program will sort them out for you) you want to decensor in after you marked the area that should be decensored
4. If you want to decensor mosaic images, click 'Open original' and put the original images in the mosaic folder
4.5 [optional] Since you will be able to compare all images later it is recommended that you put the originals for the bar images into the bar folder but not neccesary
5. Select the versions you want to decensor with
6. Click the 'Start bar decensor' or 'Start mosaic decensor' button
7. Wait for DeepCreamPy
8. If you want to save all decensored pictures, you want to 'Choose all'
9. If you want to compare the versions decensorings and the original you want to 'Choose manually'
9.5 For every image you want to have in your selected output folder, check the 'Keep' box (Tip: Use the arrow and number keys)
10. Archive the stuff you want to have saved seperately from your output, otherwise it will get deleted. I recommend archiving the input and the originals. The originals in the archive can be used by the program for future decensorings, so you need not re-add them if you want to decensor an image a second time
11. Profit

For the 3 people who care:
This GUI will not be supported indefinitely, developement will halt if one of the following things happens:
1. deeppomf asks me to stop developing it
2. I cannot start DCP anymore without opening the official DPC-GUI
3. The official DCP-GUI is more feature rich than mine
